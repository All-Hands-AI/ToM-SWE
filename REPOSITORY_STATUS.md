# Repository Status

## Overview

This document provides information about the status of the ToM-SWE repository and its relationship to the previous research repository.

## Current Status

The ToM-SWE repository is a new project focused on Theory of Mind for Software Engineering. It currently has a minimal structure:

- A basic Python package (`tom_swe`) with a single module (`core.py`)
- A simple test suite
- Basic project configuration

## Relationship to Previous Research

The files from the `xuhui` directory in the All-Hands-AI research repository have **not** been migrated to this repository. The current repository appears to be a fresh start rather than a continuation of the previous work.

The previous repository had a more complex structure including:

- A `tom_module` directory with database functionality
- Utilities for data processing and LLM configuration
- Visualization tools
- Web templates
- Comprehensive test suite

## Next Steps

If the intention is to migrate functionality from the previous research repository, the following steps would be needed:

1. Obtain a non-corrupted copy of the research repository
2. Identify which components should be migrated
3. Adapt the code to the new repository structure
4. Update tests and documentation accordingly

## Conclusion

This repository is currently in an initial state and requires further development to implement the Theory of Mind for Software Engineering functionality.
